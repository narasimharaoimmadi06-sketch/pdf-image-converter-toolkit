  "summary": "The diff addresses all three requirements. REQ-17 is handled via App.tsx wrapping all sections in ErrorBoundaries and rendering Hero, ToolGrid, Footer, and FloatingParticles. REQ-18 is handled via index.html with CDN scripts before the React bundle, PDF.js workerSrc inline script, root div with loading placeholder, and the module script tag. REQ-19 is partially addressed — App.tsx and ErrorBoundary.tsx are updated, but main.tsx is not shown in the diff; the requirement asks for a console error and visible fallback if root element is missing in main.tsx, which cannot be verified.",

      "id": "REQ-19",
      "requirement": "main.tsx must add a console error and visible fallback message if the root element is not found in the DOM.",
      "reason": "main.tsx is not present in the diff. The requirement explicitly calls for adding error handling in main.tsx for a missing root element, but no changes to main.tsx are shown. The AC 'If root element is missing, a visible error message is shown instead of a blank page' cannot be confirmed as satisfied from the diff alone.",

      "reason": "The build request only asks to fix rendering and ensure the app mounts correctly. Independently wrapping each sub-section in ErrorBoundary instances with reset and reload controls was not explicitly requested in any of the three requirements.",
